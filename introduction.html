        <h2>Project Experiences</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                 <h4>Project 1: BRAIN TUMOR DIAGNOSIS USING K-MEANS AND MORPHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS </h4>
                •	Built a brain tumor detection framework that uses techniques like Clustering, Thresholding, and Morphological Operations to help Physicians with the early detection and diagnosis of brain tumors. <br>
                •	Takes MR images of the brain as input and detects tumorous brain tissue using OpenCV. <br>
                •	Presented this work at the 3rd International Conference on Data Analytics and Management (ICDAM-22). <br>
                •	The use of Morphological Operations brings novelty to this approach. <br>
            </li>
            <li><h4>Project 2: SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM </h4>
                •	Worked as a research associate at KL University in my final semester of undergrad. <br>
                •	Actively participated in the project “Speech recognition system” which was offered by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. <br>
                •	The primary function of the Speech Recognition System was to enhance communication accessibility by enabling efficient and accurate transcription of spoken words. <br>
                •	My role in the project involved data pre-processing, feature extraction, algorithm implementation, and model evaluation. I collaborated with a team of researchers to improve the system's accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance. <br>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Passion</h2>
        <p>
            My passion lies in using cutting-edge technology to transform healthcare and communication. With a background in brain tumor detection and speech recognition systems, I am driven to create innovative solutions that improve lives and make a meaningful impact on society.
